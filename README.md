Big Little Matcher is a tool that can be used by organizations to help figure out pairings between new members and current members.

## How it works
It works by taking the names of the 'bigs' and 'littles' as well as each person's preference list and passing that information to a matching algorithm. The algorithm then 
finds and outputs all possible matchings that are stable. Learn more about stable matching [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem).
